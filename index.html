      <h2>THE CHEDDA FILES – VOL. 1: THE INCIDENT LOGS</h2>
      <p>These recordings were never supposed to exist.</p>
      <p>The government labeled the event “Project MF Chedda” and buried the footage under six layers of clearance and one very confused intern.</p>
      <p>But the signal leaks—through static, through memes, through the kind of Wi-Fi that smells like burnt popcorn and paranoia.</p>
      <p>What you’re about to see are the recovered fragments: five visual glitches left behind when Greg and Bigfoot cracked open a portal with a joint, a microwave, and the world’s most dangerous cheese.</p>
      <p>View at your own risk. Side effects may include hunger, time dilation, and an uncomfortable awareness that you’ve been here before.</p>
      <p><em>Welcome to Tin Hat Chedda. Reality melts at 420 °F.</em></p>

      <h3>FILE 01 — THE CHEDDA INCIDENT</h3>
      <p>Somewhere between midnight hunger and poor judgment, Greg finds a foil pouch stamped in red: PROJECT MF CHEDDA — DO NOT CONSUME.</p>
      <p>Bigfoot tells him to chill. Greg lights a joint instead. The microwave hums like it’s remembering the future. The air thickens. The cheese glows.</p>

      <h3>FILE 02 — THE PULL</h3>
      <p>The cheese doesn’t melt—it detonates softly, like a star folding in on itself. Greg and Bigfoot are lifted, weightless, laughing, screaming. Everything is the same sound now.</p>

      <p>Time is melted cheddar and the sky ticks backward. Every shadow whispers a recipe for madness.</p>

      <h3>FILE 05 — THE GLITCH RETURN</h3>
      <p>Greg’s reflection blinks first. Bigfoot is buffering. Reality stutters and saves as ‘Untitled Final 2.’</p>
