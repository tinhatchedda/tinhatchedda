        These recordings were never supposed to exist. The government labeled the event
        <span class="inline-red">“Project MF Chedda”</span> and buried the footage under six layers of clearance,
        three NDAs, and one very confused intern.
      </p>
      <p class="card-body">
        But leaks happen. And when your test subject is an eight-foot stoner cryptid and his paranoid tin-hatted
        best friend, the signal doesn’t stay buried. It slips out through static, memes, and Wi-Fi that smells like
        burnt popcorn and bad decisions.
      </p>
      <p class="card-body">
        What you’re about to see are the recovered fragments: five visual glitches that survived when Greg and
        Bigfoot accidentally microwaved a block of government cheese and tore a hole in their living room.

        View at your own risk. Side effects may include hunger, time dilation, and the uncomfortable realization that
        you’ve definitely been here before.

            Somewhere between midnight hunger and poor judgment, Greg finds a foil pouch stamped in angry red letters:
            <span class="inline-red">PROJECT MF CHEDDA — DO NOT CONSUME.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Bigfoot squints, shrugs, and tells him to relax. Greg sparks a joint instead of reading the fine print.
            The microwave hums like it’s remembering the future. The air thickens. The cheese starts to glow.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the timer dings, everything dings. Gravity twitches. The TV glitches. The nachos boil into a
            swirling question mark that looks suspiciously like a portal.

            The cheese doesn’t melt — it detonates softly, like a star folding in on itself. The cabin forgets how to
            be inside. The living room stretches into a spiral of clocks, cans, and stoner regret.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greg and Bigfoot are lifted out of their seats, drifting weightless toward the vortex. Greg clutches his
            joint like a life-raft. Bigfoot refuses to drop his nachos.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a split second, Greg swears the vortex winks at him. Somewhere in the echo, reality asks:
            <span class="inline-italic">“You sure you’re ready for this?”</span>

            They land in a field where every step crunches on broken clock faces. Time is scattered like cheap glass.
            Mushrooms the size of UFOs glow with impossible colors, eyes blinking in slow-motion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greg checks his phone — no service, 4,206 missed notifications. Bigfoot doesn’t care. He’s already
            investigating a cosmic shroom that looks like it wants to negotiate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sky overhead loops on itself, galaxies spinning like vinyl. Somewhere in the static, a voice repeats:

            A colossal mushroom wakes up, eyes opening like stained glass windows. Its halo spills golden spores that
            swirl into glowing text around Greg and Bigfoot.
          </p>
          <p>
            The words orbit them: <span class="inline-gold">“TWIST CLOCKWISE TO FORGET”</span> and
            <span class="inline-gold">“COUNTERCLOCKWISE TO FEED THE RABBIT HOLE.”</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Bigfoot, obviously, twists counterclockwise. The spores laugh. Somewhere, a wallet address pings.

            Reality snaps back like a rubber band. Greg and Bigfoot are suddenly at the table again. The cheese is
            just… cheese. The TV is off. Everything is quiet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then Greg notices the TV reflection: a version of himself still floating in Clockland, eyes wide, buffering.
            Bigfoot’s reflection winks, even though he isn’t moving.

            Greg’s the guy who double-encrypts his memes, won’t use public Wi-Fi, and still somehow ends up in every
            government file. He’s not a scientist — he just doomscrolled enough late-night forums to know that Bigfoot
            was real and probably blazing in the woods nearby.
          </p>
          <p class="bio-body">
            Armed with a tinfoil hat, a half-charged phone, and a chronic supply, he set out to “catch proof” of
            Bigfoot. He forgot to hit record, made a friend instead, and now he’s stuck co-owning an interdimensional
            nacho incident.

            Bigfoot has been dodging cameras for decades. Not because he’s shy — he just hates bad angles. He’s the
            universe’s most laid-back cryptid: always hungry, always smoking, and permanently down for “one more.”
          </p>
          <p class="bio-body">
            He never meant to be part of a classified project; he just followed the smell of nachos into the wrong
            cabin. Now he’s stuck in a government cheese conspiracy with a paranoid human who won’t stop narrating
            everything like a podcast.
