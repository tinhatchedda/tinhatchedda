      <h3 class="pill-label">ARCHIVE NOTE</h3>
      <h1 class="panel-title">Signal Contamination Advisory</h1>

      <p>
        This archive was rebuilt from anomaly snapshots, shredded logs, scrambled nacho-field readings, and
        out-of-order cabin footage. The reconstruction isn’t <span class="glow-letter cyan">c</span>omplete — it’s aggressive,
        chaotic, corrupted at the edges, occasionally laced with extra <span class="glow-letter cyan">o</span>dd artifacts and paranoid
        side-channels. Any attempt to “clean it up” tends to spawn new g<span class="glow-letter cyan">l</span>itches, extra logs, phantom
        frames, and temporal misfires, so the current log is l<span class="glow-letter cyan">o</span>fted in its own weird orbit and left
        as-is.
      </p>

      <p>
        Off-record: the multiverse analysts who actually stared into this thing learned one simple pattern. The
        ones who never blinked, watched the n<span class="glow-letter cyan">o</span>ise, traced the odds, spotted the c
        <span class="glow-letter cyan">l</span>ones at the edges, followed the glitches, rode the ec<span class="glow-letter cyan">l</span>ipses,
        found the hidden s<span class="glow-letter cyan">e</span>ams, trusted their gut fe<span class="glow-letter cyan">e</span>lings, and ignored the
        di<span class="glow-letter cyan">s</span>traction all landed on the same conclusion:

      <h2 class="panel-title">File 01 — The Chedda Incident</h2>
      <p>
        Greg was just trying to microwave a midnight snack and accidentally aggro-pinged the Nacho Continuum.
        Government-stamped cheese, a bored Bigfoot, and one cosmic TV dinner later, reality folded into a
        question-mark vortex over the kitchen table.

    <section class="file-panel">
      <h2 class="panel-title">File 02 — The Pull</h2>
      <p>
        The vortex doesn’t just warp the room — it grabs everything that believes in gravity. Nacho shrapnel,
        clocks, junk mail, Greg’s paranoia, and finally the one thing he never meant to drop: his joint.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this log, the joint slips out of Greg’s mouth and spins in slow motion toward the cheese tunnel.
        Greg’s eyes lock onto it like it’s the last brain cell he has left. While Bigfoot keeps casually eating,
        Greg paddles the air, twisting and reaching, doing whatever he can to snatch it back before it
        crosses the event-munch horizon.

    <section class="file-panel">
      <h2 class="panel-title">File 03 — The Tin Hat Protocol</h2>
      <p>
        Somewhere between panic and enlightenment, Greg starts treating the vortex like an update he didn’t agree
        to. Tinfoil hats become firewall patches. Couch cushions become sandbags against cosmic packet loss. The
        cabin turns into a low-budget observatory with very high scientists.
      </p>

      <h2 class="panel-title">File 04 — Spore Prophecy</h2>
      <p>
        Out in the mycelium district, time runs on mushroom logic. Greg and Bigfoot stumble into a grove of
        sentient caps that speak only in rings and riddles. One central spore-god offers a simple mechanic:
        twist clockwise to forget, twist counter-clockwise to feed the portal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Greg wants to remember. Bigfoot wants more snacks. The mushrooms want content. Nobody agrees on which
        way to turn, but the vortex hears every vote.

      <h2 class="panel-title">File 05 — The Glitch Return</h2>
      <p>
        The cabin reloads like a half-remembered save file. The cheese spiral stutters between frames, Greg’s
        reflection blinks before he does, and Bigfoot keeps eating as if nothing has ever happened in any
        universe. Reality feels like someone keeps hitting “undo” and “export” at the same time.

      <p>
        This loop was recovered from an unstable holo-feed. Greg and Bigfoot walk endlessly across a stitched-up
        grid while the system keeps generating new light platforms under their feet — a spatial treadmill for the
        chronically baked.
      </p>
      <p>
        The transmission loops forever. Just like their walk. Just like time. Just like your last edible.

    <!-- MEET THE USUAL SUSPECTS -->
    <section class="file-panel">
      <h3 class="pill-label">Meet the Usual Suspects</h3>

      <h2 class="panel-title">Greg — Subject: The Paranoid Optimist</h2>
      <p>
        Greg didn’t mean to become the protagonist of a classified cheese event. He was chasing proof of Bigfoot,
        obsessing over grainy screenshots and message-board lore, and accidentally filmed his own origin story
        instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        He’s paranoid, sure — but he’s not wrong nearly as often as everyone would like. Greg connects dots no one
        else even sees… usually while incredibly baked, with his joint welded to his mouth like a cursor.
      </p>

      <h2 class="panel-title">Bigfoot — Subject: The Chill</h2>
      <p>
        Eight feet of vibes. Snack-based belief system. Camera shy, not clout shy. Bigfoot has been dodging phone
        cameras and hunters since before the internet, mostly because he refuses to get tagged in anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        He runs on a strict diet of smoke, snacks, and not caring what dimension he’s currently in as long as
        there’s food. When Greg showed up trying to “get evidence,” Bigfoot let him stay — mostly because he kept
        bringing better nachos.
      </p>

      <h2 class="panel-title">7B_Ω — Subject: The Intern</h2>
      <p>
        Officially: a background process assigned to monitor cheddar-based anomalies. Unofficially: the overworked
        cosmic intern who keeps stamping “do not consume” on things nobody listens to.
      </p>
      <p>
        7B_Ω is the one who filed this entire mess under “educational material” instead of “containment breach,”
        which is why you’re reading it now. Whether that was an accident or part of the protocol is still
        redacted.

      <h2 class="panel-title">Intergalactic Strain Protocol</h2>

      <p>
        The Council whispers of strains not grown on Earth. Bud so cosmic the smoke curls into prophecies and ash
        falls in the shape of forgotten constellations.
      </p>
      <p>
        They say the answer reveals itself only when your mind drifts past the Oort Cloud, when your lungs forget
        gravity, and your thoughts tune to a frequency shared by stoners and starships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until then, every “password” is just noise from a lower timeline. Come back when you’re higher than your
        last theory.
