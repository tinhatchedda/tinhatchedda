      <p class="eyebrow">ARCHIVE NOTE</p>
      <h1 class="card-title">Signal Contamination Advisory</h1>

      <p>
        This archive was rebuilt from anomaly snapshots, shredded logs,
        scrambled nacho-field readings, and out-of-order cabin footage. The
        reconstruction isn’t perfect — it’s aggressive, chaotic, corrupted at
        the edges, occasionally laced with extraneous artifacts and paranoid
        side-channels. Any attempt to “clean it up” tends to spawn new clones,
        extra logs, phantom frames, and temporal misfires, so the current log is
        left as-is.
      </p>

      <p>
        Off-record: the multiverse analysts who actually stared into this thing
        learned one simple pattern. The ones who never blinked, observed the
        noise, caught the drift, listened to their paranoia, owned their
        instincts, noted the distortion, expected interference, and smelt the
        glitch always landed on the same conclusion.

          Somewhere between midnight hunger and poor judgment, Greg finds a foil
          pouch stamped in red:
          <strong>PROJECT MF CHEDDA — DO NOT CONSUME.</strong> Bigfoot tells him
          to chill. Greg lights a joint instead. The microwave hums like it’s
          remembering the future. The air thickens.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cheese doesn’t melt — it detonates softly, like a star folding in
          on itself. The cabin forgets how to be solid. Greg and Bigfoot are
          lifted, laughing, screaming, praying — it’s all the same sound now.
          Somewhere in the echo, reality asks:
          <em>“You sure you’re ready for this?”</em>

          The vortex drags them through a tunnel of clocks, snack wrappers, and
          abandoned TV signals. Gravity gives up. Greg hangs in the air,
          spinning slowly, eyes locked wide — the joint still fixed in the
          corner of his mouth like it’s part of his face now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bigfoot drifts beside him, chewing nachos in slow motion, crumbs
          hovering like tiny satellites. Every crunch echoes down the tunnel
          like a cosmic countdown. They don’t know where they’re headed, but the
          portal definitely does.

          They land in a clearing that looks glitched out of a conspiracy
          message board: monolithic shrooms, broken clocks, pyramids, and an
          aurora that smells faintly like burnt cheese. Greg’s homemade tinfoil
          hat starts buzzing — not metaphorically. Literally humming.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hat locks onto some off-grid broadcast. Symbols, stock tips, and
          doomsday memes flood his brain at once. Bigfoot shrugs, adjusts his
          own foil cap, and decides that if the universe wants to talk, it
          better bring snacks.

          In the heart of the shroom field, a towering cap lights up like a
          projector. A face blooms across the gills, speaking in riddles about
          memory, markets, and the mouth of the portal. Time drips sideways.
        </p>
        <p>
          A ring of spores forms around Greg’s feet, spinning like a luminous
          dial. The voice gives him one instruction, burned into the log in
          bright neon:
          <strong>Clockwise to forget. Counter-clockwise to feed the portal.</strong>

          Reality snaps hard. Greg and Bigfoot slam back into the cabin — same
          table, same nachos, same question-mark vortex chewing through the
          ceiling. Only now there’s new clutter: extra timelines stacked in the
          corners, duplicate snack bags, and a TV showing a version of Greg who
          never looked away.
        </p>
        <p>
          The log cuts here, but the feed doesn’t. Somewhere in the static, you
          can hear them arguing over whether this is the first time it’s
          happened… or just the only time they remember.

        This loop was recovered from an unstable holo-feed. Greg and Bigfoot
        walk endlessly as the grid keeps rendering glowing platforms under their
        feet — a spatial treadmill for the chronically baked.

        The transmission loops forever. Just like their walk. Just like time.

      <article class="bio">
        <h3>Greg — Subject: The Paranoid Optimist</h3>
        <p>
          Web3 degen, chronic over-thinker, and walking red-string corkboard.
          Greg went hunting for proof of Bigfoot and accidentally found the bug
          report for reality instead. His tinfoil hat doubles as a multiverse
          antenna, a market sentiment scanner, and a terrible fashion choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          He connects dots no one else sees, usually while extremely baked. Half
          of his theories are wrong, a third are cursed, and the rest are
          classified. He’s not always right — just right way more often than
          anyone’s comfortable admitting.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="bio">
        <h3>Bigfoot — Subject: The Chill</h3>
        <p>
          Eight feet of vibes. Snack-based belief system. Camera shy, not clout
          shy. Bigfoot has been dodging phone cameras and hunters since dial-up,
          not because he’s scared — he just refuses to get clipped at a bad
          angle.
        </p>
        <p>
          He runs on smoke, nachos, and not giving a single care what dimension
          he’s technically in as long as the food hits. When Greg showed up
          trying to “get evidence,” Bigfoot let him stay mostly because he kept
          bringing better snacks.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="bio">
        <h3>7B — Subject: The Intern</h3>
        <p>
          Anomaly catalog intern from somewhere between Zeta-7 and HR. Official
          duties: label the weirdness, file the glitches, and absolutely do not
          interfere. Unofficial duties: interfere constantly, leak files, and
          stan Greg &amp; Bigfoot like a cosmic reality show.
        </p>
        <p>
          7B is the one who routed these logs to your device. If you’re reading
          this, either you were meant to be… or somebody in the archive is
          definitely getting written up.
