      <p class="eyebrow">ARCHIVE NOTE</p>
      <h1 class="section-title">Signal Contamination Advisory</h1>

      <p>
        This archive was rebuilt from anomaly snapshots, shredded logs, scrambled nacho-field
        readings, and out-of-order cabin footage. The reconstruction isn’t perfect — it’s
        aggressive, chaotic, corrupted at the edges, occasionally laced with extra
        <span class="code-letter">a</span>rtifacts and paranoid side-channels. Any attempt to
        “clean it up” tends to spawn new clo<span class="code-letter">c</span>es, extra logs,
        phantom frames, and temporal misfires, so the current log is left as-is.
      </p>

      <p>
        Off-record: the multiverse analysts who actually stared into this thing learned one
        simple pattern. The ones who never blinked, watched the <span class="code-letter">c</span>hatter,
        rode the <span class="code-letter">e</span>choes, trusted the <span class="code-letter">p</span>atterns,
        and ignored the noise all landed on the same conclusion.

            Somewhere between midnight hunger and poor judgment, Greg finds a foil pouch
            stamped in angry red letters: <strong>PROJECT MF CHEDDA — DO NOT CONSUME.</strong>
            Bigfoot tells him to chill. Greg lights a joint instead. The microwave hums like
            it’s remembering the future. The air thickens. The cheese glows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reality kinks sideways. A spiral of molten cheddar punches through the cabin
            ceiling, dragging ash, crumbs, and loose thoughts into orbit.

            The cheese doesn’t melt — it detonates softly, like a star folding in on itself.
            Greg feels his shoes forget gravity. Bigfoot’s chair forgets the floor. Nacho
            shrapnel hangs in the air like tiny, crunchy satellites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greg drifts backward toward the vortex, joint still clamped between his lips,
            eyes wide but weirdly impressed. Bigfoot floats with him, unfazed, still chewing.
            Clocks, cans, and VHS tapes spiral around them as the cabin unzips into pure
            swirl.
          </p>
          <p>
            Somewhere in the echo, reality quietly asks: <em>“You sure you’re ready for this?”</em>
            Greg doesn’t answer. He just inhales.

            On the other side, the sky looks like a late-night cartoon had a panic
            attack on a black hole. Mushrooms watch the watchers. Pyramids hum like
            Wi-Fi routers for ghosts. Every billboard is targeted directly at Greg’s
            anxiety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greg finally does what any responsible paranoiac would do: tightens his
            tin foil hat, bumps his threat level from “vibing” to “trust no feed,” and
            starts treating every glitch as a message. Bigfoot treats every glitch as
            a snack opportunity.

            Deep in the spore fields, a towering mushroom priest broadcasts a message
            straight into Greg’s skull: the Chedda vortex is a key, not a glitch.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Clockwise to forget.</strong> Memories dissolve, timelines reset,
            clones spawn with slightly worse taste in snacks.  
            <strong>Counter-clockwise to feed the portal.</strong> The vortex grows, chewing
            through fake timelines and knockoff realities until only the original signal
            remains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greg writes all of this down on a napkin. Bigfoot uses the napkin as a plate.

            Back in the cabin, nothing quite matches the save file. The TV runs scenes that
            never aired. The microwave door opens on static. Greg catches his own reflection
            lagging by half a frame.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bigfoot shrugs it off. Greg does not. Somewhere between the skipped frames,
            something else blinks — watching them both, waiting for the next rewind.

        The transmission loops forever. Just like their walk. Just like time. Just like the

          Now he’s stuck as co-main character in a multiverse breach he absolutely does not
