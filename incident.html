        This <span class="glow-letter cyan">a</span>rchive was rebuilt from anomaly snapshots,
        shredded logs, scrambled na<span class="glow-letter cyan">c</span>ho-field readings, and
        out-of-order cabin footage. The reconstruction isn’t
        <span class="glow-letter cyan">c</span>omplete — it’s aggressive, chaotic, corrupted at the
        <span class="glow-letter cyan">c</span>orners, occasionally la<span class="glow-letter cyan">c</span>ed
        with extr<span class="glow-letter cyan">e</span>aneous artifacts and paran<span class="glow-letter cyan">o</span>id
        side-channels. Any attem<span class="glow-letter cyan">p</span>t to “clean it up” tends to
        sent ou<span class="glow-letter cyan">t</span> new glitches, spawn fresh timeline dri<span class="glow-letter cyan">f</span>ts,
        phant<span class="glow-letter cyan">o</span>m frames, and twist tra<span class="glow-letter cyan">c</span>ks, so the

      <p>
        Off-record: the multiverse analysts who actually stared into this thing learned one pattern.
        The ones who never blinked, watched the cha<span class="glow-letter yellow">t</span>ter,
        traced the hidden <span class="glow-letter yellow">r</span>outes, listened to the
        <span class="glow-letter yellow">u</span>nstable frequencies, rode the de<span class="glow-letter yellow">s</span>ert
        of static, and followed the stran<span class="glow-letter yellow">t</span>est leads always
        landed on the same conclusion. When the noise fades, the only signal left is
        <span class="glow-letter yellow">c</span>onsistent, quietly <span class="glow-letter yellow">h</span>umming
        in the ba<span class="glow-letter yellow">e</span>kground, looping through distorted

      <p>
        Greg and Bigfoot accidentally heat up a government-labeled block of
        “Project MF Chedda.” The cheese hums, the air bends, and a vortex tears
        open their living-room reality. Bigfoot just calls it “snack time with
        extra steps.”

      <p>
        Gravity forgets what it’s doing. Greg is sucked toward the cheese vortex,
        couch and clocks tumbling with him. Mid-spin, his joint slips from his
        lips and starts orbiting like a tiny burning satellite. Greg’s entire
        survival plan becomes: don’t die, don’t lose the joint.

      <p>
        Somewhere between panic and enlightenment, Greg’s paranoia pays off.
        Every scrap of tin foil he’s ever hoarded snaps into a higher purpose:
        improvised multiverse firewalls, signal reflectors, and drip-guard for
        cosmic nacho runoff.

        Outside the cabin, reality grows mushrooms the size of surveillance
        balloons. Each spore cloud carries a different timeline. Clockwise,
        you forget why you were here. Counterclockwise, you feed the portal and
        remember too much.

        The cabin reassembles itself like a half-remembered meme. Greg’s
        reflection blinks on a different beat. Bigfoot keeps eating as if this
        is just another rerun. Reality stutters, buffers, and quietly saves
        itself as “Untitled Final 2.”

        This loop was recovered from an unstable holo-feed. Greg and Bigfoot
        walk endlessly as the grid generates new platforms under their feet —
        a spatial treadmill for the chronically baked.

        The transmission loops forever. Just like their walk. Just like time.
        Just like your last edible.

    <!-- MEET THE USUAL SUSPECTS -->
    <section class="file-panel">
      <div class="pill-label">Meet the Usual Suspects</div>

      <h2 class="panel-title">Greg — Subject: The Paranoid Optimist</h2>
      <p>
        Greg didn’t mean to become the protagonist of a classified cheese event.
        He was chasing proof of Bigfoot, obsessing over grainy screenshots and
        message-board lore, and accidentally filmed his own origin story
        instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        He’s paranoid, sure — but he’s not wrong nearly as often as everyone
        would like. Greg connects dots no one else even sees… usually while
        incredibly baked, with his joint welded to his mouth like a cursor.
      </p>

      <h2 class="panel-title">Bigfoot — Subject: The Chill</h2>
      <p>
        Eight feet of vibes. Snack-based belief system. Camera shy, not clout
        shy. Bigfoot has been dodging phone cameras and hunters since before the
        internet, mostly because he refuses to get tagged in anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        He runs on a strict diet of smoke, snacks, and not caring what dimension
        he’s currently in as long as there’s food. When Greg showed up trying to
        “get evidence,” Bigfoot let him stay — mostly because he kept bringing
        better nachos.
      </p>

      <h2 class="panel-title">7B_Ω — Subject: The Intern</h2>
      <p>
        Officially: a background process assigned to monitor cheddar-based
        anomalies. Unofficially: the overworked cosmic intern who keeps stamping
        “do not consume” on things nobody listens to.
      </p>
      <p>
        7B_Ω is the one who filed this entire mess under “educational material”
        instead of “containment breach,” which is why you’re reading it now.
        Whether that was an accident or part of the protocol is still redacted.

      <div class="pill-label">High Council Auth Check</div>
      <h2 class="panel-title">Intergalactic Strain Protocol</h2>
      <p>
        Somewhere beyond the Nacho Continuum, there’s a grow op that never shows
        up on maps. The buds hum at a frequency you can feel in your teeth. The
        smoke doesn’t just rise — it remembers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rumor says the High Council built their whole voting system on
        intergalactic strains: each hit nudges the timeline, each exhale
        rewrites which version of you wakes up tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of those strains carries the key to this archive. No QR code, no
        seed phrase, no roadmap — just a moment where you’re exactly high enough
        to see the pattern that was always there.
      </p>
      <p>
        They say the answer reveals itself when your mind drifts past the Oort
        Cloud, your lungs forget gravity, and your thoughts tune to a frequency
        shared by stoners and starships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until then, every “password” is just noise from a lower timeline. Come
        back when you’re higher than your last theory.
