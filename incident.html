            Somewhere between midnight hunger and poor judgment, Greg finds a foil pouch
            stamped in angry red letters:
            <strong>PROJECT MF CHEDDA — DO NOT CONSUME.</strong> Bigfoot tells him to chill.
            Greg lights a joint instead. The microwave hums like it’s remembering the
            future. The air thickens. The cheese glows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reality kinks sideways. A spiral of molten cheddar punches through the cabin
            ceiling, dragging ash, crumbs, and loose thoughts into orbit. Greg swears he
            can hear the universe buffering.

            The cheese doesn’t melt — it detonates softly, like a star folding in on
            itself. The cabin forgets how to be solid. Greg and Bigfoot are lifted,
            laughing, screaming, praying — it’s all the same sound now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Time stretches into orange tunnels. Clocks spin out of their frames.
            Nacho shrapnel floats like tiny satellites. Bigfoot rides the pull with a
            nacho still in his hand. Greg tumbles through the vortex in slow motion,
            eyes wide, reaching for his spinning joint. No matter how
            hard reality spins, it never leaves his sight.

            Greg’s emergency plan is simple: when in doubt, add more foil. He upgrades
            his tin hat mid-teleport, crimping layers like he’s speedrunning a DIY
            tutorial for quantum paranoia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hat doesn’t block the signal — it tunes it. Suddenly Greg can see
            probability trails, echo timelines, and what Bigfoot would look like if
            he’d said no to the nachos. He doesn’t like that version, so he leans
            harder into this one.

            The landing isn’t really a landing — more like getting gently misfiled

            Their caps glow with symbols that weren’t in any of Greg’s conspiracy
            folders.

          <p>
            One spore cloud forms a repeating message: twist the dial clockwise to
            forget, counterclockwise to feed the portal. Greg stares at it for a long
            time. Bigfoot twists nothing, remembers everything, and keeps walking.

            Eventually, the universe gets tired of being inside out and snaps them

            different. The TV is different. The timeline swears nothing has changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greg’s reflection on the screen blinks a few frames late. Bigfoot’s
            nachos refill themselves whenever no one is looking. Somewhere in the

          <h3>Greg — Subject: The Paranoid Optimist</h3>
          <p>
            Greg didn’t mean to become a multiverse node. He just followed too many
            late-night threads, smoked too many “this one’s different” joints, and
            connected one piece of government cheese that probably shouldn’t have
            existed. He went hunting for proof of Bigfoot and accidentally filmed his
            own origin story instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            He’s paranoid, sure — but he’s not wrong nearly as often as everyone
            would like. Greg connects dots no one else even sees… usually while
            incredibly baked, with his joint welded to his mouth like a cursor.

          <h3>Bigfoot — Subject: The Chill</h3>
          <p>
            Eight feet of vibes. Snack-based belief system. Camera shy, not clout
            shy. Bigfoot has been dodging phone cameras and hunters since before the
            internet, mostly because he refuses to get tagged in anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            He runs on a strict diet of smoke, snacks, and not caring what dimension
            he’s currently in as long as there’s food. When Greg showed up trying to
            “get evidence,” Bigfoot let him stay — mostly because he kept bringing
            better nachos.

          <h3>7B_Ω — Subject: The Intern</h3>
          <p>
            Officially: a background process assigned to monitor cheddar-based
            anomalies. Unofficially: the overworked cosmic intern who keeps stamping
            “do not consume” on things nobody listens to.
          </p>
          <p>
            7B_Ω is the one who filed this entire mess under “educational material”
            instead of “containment breach,” which is how you’re reading it now.
            Whether that was an accident or part of the protocol is still redacted.
