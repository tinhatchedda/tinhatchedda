        Off-record: the analysts who actually stared into this thing learned one pattern. The

      <p>
        Greg and Bigfoot accidentally heat up a government-labeled block of
        <span class="project-mf">Project MF Chedda</span>. The cheese hums, the air bends,
        and a vortex tears open their living-room reality. Bigfoot just calls it
        “snack time with extra steps.”

      <div class="pill-label">File 02 — The Pull</div>
      <p>
        Gravity forgets what it’s doing. Greg is sucked toward the cheese vortex, couch and clocks tumbling
        with him. Mid-spin, his joint slips from his lips and starts orbiting like a tiny burning satellite.
        Greg’s entire survival plan becomes: don’t die, don’t lose the joint.

      <div class="pill-label">File 03 — The Tin Hat Protocol</div>
      <p>
        Somewhere between panic and enlightenment, Greg’s paranoia pays off. Every scrap of foil he’s ever
        hoarded snaps into a higher purpose: improvised multiverse firewalls, signal reflectors, and drip-guard
        for cosmic nacho runoff. Bigfoot just thinks it looks “kinda hard.”

      <p>
        Outside the cabin, reality grows mushrooms the size of surveillance balloons. Each spore cloud carries
        a different timeline. Clockwise, you forget why you were here. Counter-clockwise, you feed the portal
        and remember too much.

      <p>
        The cabin reassembles itself like a half-remembered meme. Greg’s reflection blinks on a different beat.
        Bigfoot keeps eating as if this is just another rerun. Reality stutters, buffers, and quietly saves
        itself as “Untitled Final 2.”

        This loop was recovered from an unstable holo-feed. Greg and Bigfoot walk endlessly as the grid
        generates new platforms under their feet — a spatial treadmill for the chronically baked.

        The transmission loops forever. Just like their walk. Just like time. Just like your last edible.

        <p class="bio-entry">
          Greg didn’t mean to become the protagonist of a classified cheese event. He was chasing proof of
          Bigfoot, obsessing over grainy screenshots and message-board lore, and accidentally filmed his own
          origin story instead.
        </p>
        <p class="bio-entry">
          He’s paranoid, sure — but he’s not wrong nearly as often as everyone would like. Greg connects dots
          no one else even sees… usually while incredibly baked, with his joint welded to his mouth like a
          cursor and his brain insisting this is all “for the documentary” that only exists in his drafts
          folder and three alternate timelines.

          Eight feet of vibes. Snack-based belief system. Camera shy, not clout shy. Bigfoot has been dodging

          He runs on a strict diet of smoke, snacks, and not caring what dimension he’s currently in as long as
          there’s food. When Greg showed up trying to “get evidence,” Bigfoot let him stay — mostly because he
          kept bringing better nachos, and partially because someone has to hold the bowl while reality clips
          through the floor.

          higher-order protocol is still redacted — mostly because nobody wants to admit the multiverse might be

      <h2 class="panel-title">Intergalactic Strain Protocol</h2>

      <p>
        Somewhere beyond the Nacho Continuum, there’s a grow-op that never shows up on maps. The buds hum at a
        frequency you can feel in your teeth. The smoke doesn’t just rise — it remembers where you’ve been
        dimension-hopping.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rumor says the High Council built their whole voting system on intergalactic strains: each hit nudges the
        timeline, each exhale rewrites which version of you wakes up tomorrow, and every cough gets logged as a
        minor reality quake.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of those strains carries the key to this archive. No QR code, no seed phrase, no roadmap — just a
        single, stupidly perfect moment where you’re exactly high enough to see the pattern that was always there.
      </p>
      <p>
        They say the answer reveals itself only when your mind drifts past the Oort Cloud, your lungs forget
        gravity, and your thoughts tune to a frequency shared by stoners and starships arguing over the aux cord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until then, every “password” is just noise from a lower timeline. Come back when you’re higher than your
        last theory.
      </p>

        <div class="pill-label">Vol 2 Node — Intergalactic Strains</div>
        <p>
          Some archivists insist the unlock phrase is hidden somewhere in the noise — scattered letters, stray
          signals, and one specific strain name whispered under somebody’s breath. Nobody agrees on which strain
          it was. Nobody wrote it down. Everyone remembers the vibe.
