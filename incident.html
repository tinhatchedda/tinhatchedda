        This <span class="hidden-letter hidden-letter--cyan">A</span>rchive was rebuilt from anomaly snapshots,
        shredded logs, scrambled nacho-field readings, and out-of-order cabin footage. The reconstruction isn’t
        complete — it’s aggressive, chaotic, corrupted at the corners, occasionally <span class="hidden-letter hidden-letter--cyan">C</span>racked
        at the edges and <span class="hidden-letter hidden-letter--cyan">C</span>rosswired with extraneous artifacts and paranoid
        side-channels. Any att<span class="hidden-letter hidden-letter--cyan">E</span>mpt to “clean it up” tends to
        s<span class="hidden-letter hidden-letter--cyan">P</span>awn new glitches,
        twis<span class="hidden-letter hidden-letter--cyan">T</span> timelines, fracture
        <span class="hidden-letter hidden-letter--cyan">N</span>odes,

        glitch <span class="hidden-letter hidden-letter--cyan">E</span>choes,
        and duplicate <span class="hidden-letter hidden-letter--cyan">S</span>ignals, so the current log is left as-is.

      <p>
        Off-record: the multiverse analysts who actually stared into this thing learned one simple pattern.
        The ones who never blinked, watched the chatter, traced the hidden routes, listened to the unstable
        frequencies, rode the desert of static, and followed the strangest leads always landed on the same
        conclusion. When the noise fades, the only signal left is consistent, quietly humming in the
        background, looping through distorted data, glitched dreams, and recursive anomalies:

      <h2 class="panel-kicker">File 01 — The Chedda Incident</h2>
      <p>
        Greg and Bigfoot accidentally heat up a government-labeled block of
        <span class="project-mf">Project MF Chedda</span>. The cheese hums, the air bends,
        and a vortex tears open their living-room reality. Bigfoot just calls it “snack time with extra steps.”

      <h2 class="panel-kicker">File 02 — The Cam Site Broadcast</h2>
      <p>
        Greg sets up a late-night stream to “finally prove Bigfoot is real.” Instead, his joint slips out of his mouth
        mid-rant and starts spinning in zero-gravity cheese fumes while chat loses its mind. The feed cuts right before
        the vortex picks a favorite viewer.

      <h2 class="panel-kicker">File 03 — The Tin Hat Protocol</h2>
      <p>
        After the breach, a rushed protocol is pushed to the Nacho Continuum Archives: mandatory tin-hat deployment for
        all humans within snack radius. Compliance is low. Fashion adoption is high.

        keep taking notes on who spins what, and how often.

        This loop was recovered from an unstable holo-feed. Greg and Bigfoot walk endlessly as the grid generates new
        platforms under their feet — a spatial treadmill for the chronically baked.

        The transmission loops forever. Just like their walk. Just like time. Just like your last edible.

      <h2 class="panel-kicker">High Council Auth Check</h2>
      <h1 class="panel-title">Intergalactic Strain Protocol</h1>

      <p>
        Somewhere beyond the Nacho Continuum, there’s a grow-op that never shows up on maps. The buds hum at a
        frequency you can feel in your teeth. The smoke doesn’t just rise — it remembers where you’ve been
        dimension-hopping.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rumor says the High Council built their whole voting system on intergalactic strains: each hit nudges the
        timeline, each exhale rewrites which version of you wakes up tomorrow, and every cough gets logged as a minor
        reality quake.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of those strains carries the key to this archive. No QR code, no seed phrase, no roadmap — just a single,
        stupidly perfect moment where you’re exactly high enough to see the pattern that was always there.
      </p>
      <p>
        They say the answer reveals itself only when your mind drifts past the Oort Cloud, your lungs forget gravity,
        and your thoughts tune to a frequency shared by stoners and starships arguing over the aux cord.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until then, every “password” is just noise from a lower timeline. Come back when you’re higher than your last
        theory.
      </p>

      <div class="teaser-panel">
        <h3 class="panel-kicker">Vol 2 Node — Intergalactic Strains</h3>
        <p>
          Some archivists insist the unlock phrase is hidden somewhere in the noise — scattered letters, stray signals,
          and one specific strain name whispered under somebody’s breath. Nobody agrees on which strain it was. Nobody
          wrote it down. Everyone remembers the vibe.

    <!-- MEET THE USUAL SUSPECTS -->
    <section class="panel panel-usual-suspects">
      <h2 class="panel-kicker">Meet the Usual Suspects</h2>

      <!-- Greg -->
      <article class="character-profile">
        <p class="subject-stamp subject-stamp--cyan">
          SUBJECT ID: GREG_01 &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; STATUS: PARANOID OPTIMIST
        </p>
        <h3>Greg — Subject: The Paranoid Optimist</h3>
        <p>
          Greg didn’t mean to become the protagonist of a classified cheese event. He was chasing proof of Bigfoot,
          obsessing over grainy screenshots and message-board lore, and accidentally filmed his own origin story
          instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          He’s paranoid, sure — but he’s not wrong nearly as often as everyone would like. Greg connects dots no one
          else even sees… usually while incredibly baked, with his joint welded to his mouth like a cursor and his
          brain insisting this is all “for the documentary” that only exists in his drafts folder and three alternate
          timelines.
        </p>

      <!-- Bigfoot -->
      <article class="character-profile">
        <p class="subject-stamp subject-stamp--magenta">
          SUBJECT ID: BGF_08 &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; STATUS: THE CHILL
        </p>
        <h3>Bigfoot — Subject: The Chill</h3>
        <p>
          Eight feet of vibes. Snack-based belief system. Camera shy, not clout shy. Bigfoot has been dodging phone
          cameras and hunters since before the internet, mostly because he refuses to get tagged in anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          He runs on a strict diet of smoke, snacks, and not caring what dimension he’s currently in as long as there’s
          food. When Greg showed up trying to “get evidence,” Bigfoot let him stay — mostly because he kept bringing
          better nachos, and partially because someone has to hold the bowl while reality clips through the floor.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- 7B_Ω -->
      <article class="character-profile">
        <p class="subject-stamp subject-stamp--yellow">
          SUBJECT ID: 7B_Ω &nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp; ROLE: COSMIC INTERN
        </p>
        <h3>7B_Ω — Subject: The Intern</h3>
        <p>
          Officially: a background process assigned to monitor cheddar-based anomalies. Unofficially: the overworked
          cosmic intern who keeps stamping “do not consume” on things nobody listens to.
        </p>
        <p>
          7B_Ω is the one who filed this entire mess under “educational material” instead of “containment breach,” which
          is why you’re reading it now. Whether that was an accident, a bit, or part of a higher-order protocol is still
          redacted — mostly because nobody wants to admit the multiverse might be running on unpaid internship energy.
