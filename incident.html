      <p>
        This archive was rebuilt from anomaly snapshots, shredded logs,
        scrambled nacho-field readings, and out-of-order cabin footage.
        The reconstruction isn’t perfect — it’s
        <span class="hl-clone">a</span>ggressive, chaotic, corrupted at
        the edges, occasionally laced with extr<span class="hl-clone">a</span>
        neous artifacts and paranoi<span class="hl-clone">c</span> side-channels.
        Any attempt to “clean it up” tends to spawn new clones,
        extra logs, phantom fram<span class="hl-clone">e</span>s,
        and temporal misfires, so the current log is left as-is.
      </p>

      <p>
        Off-record: the multiverse analysts who actually stared into
        this thing learned one pattern. The ones who never blinked,
        observed the noise, caught the drift, listened to their
        paranoia, owned their instincts, noted the distortion, expected
        interfere<span class="hl-clone">p</span>ce, and smelt the glitch
        always landed on the same conclusion:

        Greg heats up a government-labeled block of
        “Project MF Chedda.” The microwave hums, the air bends, and
        a vortex tears open the living room. Bigfoot just keeps

        The more the universe glitches, the tighter Greg wraps his
        foil. Turns out the hat doesn’t block the signal — it amplifies
        it. Every paranoid thought becomes a possible map of where the
        portal spits them out next.

          Not a scientist. Just dangerously curious with a stable supply
          of flower and a questionable search history. Greg went looking
          for proof of Bigfoot so he could leak it to the internet and
          farm clout. Instead, he ended up freelancing as the main
          antenna for a nacho-powered multiverse rift. He connects dots
          no one else sees — usually while extremely baked — and he’s
          right just often enough that it’s a problem.

          Eight feet of vibes. Snack-based belief system. Camera shy,
          not clout shy. Bigfoot has been evading phone cameras since
          before the internet, not because he’s scared — he just refuses
          to get clipped at a bad angle. He runs on smoke, snacks, and
          the unshakable conviction that none of this is his fault as
          long as he keeps chewing.

          They touched the cheese. Now they’re quietly routing clips,

          still feel real.
