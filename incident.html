      <h2 class="section-label">ARCHIVE NOTE</h2>
      <h3 class="section-title">SIGNAL CONTAMINATION ADVISORY</h3>

      <p class="file-copy">
        This archive was rebuilt from anomaly snapshots, shredded logs, scrambled nacho-field readings, and
        out-of-order cabin footage. The reconstruction isn’t perfect — it's aggressive, chaotic, corrupted at the edges,
        occasionally laced with extraneous artifacts and paranoid side-channels. Any attempt to “clean it up” tends to 
        spawn new clones, extra logs, phantom frames, and temporal misfires, so the current log is left as-is.
      </p>

      <p class="file-copy">
        Off-record: the multiverse analysts who actually stared into this thing learned one pattern. The ones who never 
        blinked, observed the noise, caught the drift, listened to their paranoia, owned their instincts, noted the distortion,
        expected interference, and smelt the glitch always landed on the same conclusion.

    <section class="panel">
      <h2 class="file-title">FILE 02 — THE CAM SITE BROADCAST</h2>

      <p class="file-copy">
        Greg’s joint pops out of his mouth the second gravity decides to nope out, drifting beside him like a slow-burning 
        satellite. The cabin stretches into a swirling cheese wind tunnel as snack wrappers, CRT monitors, and loose clocks 
        tumble through zero-G. Greg freezes mid-spin, eyes wide, trying to grab the joint as it orbits him like a cosmic tease.
      </p>

      <p class="file-copy">
        Bigfoot, meanwhile, floats past him completely unbothered, casually eating nachos like this is all a totally normal 
        Tuesday. Whether the broadcast was staged, hijacked, or leaked remains unknown — but the anomaly appears stable 
        enough to study… for now.

      <h2 class="file-title">FILE 04 — SPORE PROPHECY</h2>

      <p class="file-copy">
        The spore patterns were first mistaken for mold growth — until the symbols began to shift between refreshes.
        Analysts eventually identified two repeating rotational sequences.

      <p class="file-copy">
        Anyone exposed to the spores reportedly changes their walking orientation based on whichever impulse hits harder:
        the desire to forget… or the need to feed.

        This loop was recovered from an unstable holo-feed. Greg and Bigfoot walk endlessly as the grid generates new
        platforms under their feet — a spatial treadmill for the chronically baked.
