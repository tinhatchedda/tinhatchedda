            Greg and Bigfoot spark up inside a cramped cabin when an experimental
            block of government-grade nacho cheese — Project MF CHEDDA — reacts
            to the heat and reality folds like a cheap tent.
            <br><br>
            Smoke drifts, colors warp, and the cheese begins humming at a
            frequency only stoners and cryptids can hear. The incident begins.

            Gravity calls out sick.
            Greg float-drifts toward the cheese vortex, wide-eyed with a joint
            still hanging from his mouth. Bigfoot doesn’t panic — he just keeps
            eating his nachos as debris spirals around them in lazy orbit.
            <br><br>
            The portal grows brighter. Reality feels optional.

          <p class="file-desc">
            The Mushroom Oracle boots up like a psychedelic BIOS screen —
            cap glowing, spores drifting, forest humming like a malfunctioning
            government microwave.
            <br><br>
            Then the message beams straight into their skulls:
            <br><br>
            <strong class="prophecy-line">
              “Clockwise to forget…<br>
              Counterclockwise to feed the portal.”
            </strong>
            <br><br>
            No context.
            No instructions.
            Just cosmic directions from a fungus older than taxes and way higher
            than both of them combined.
            <br><br>
            Greg’s paranoia spikes — he’s convinced this thing knows his search
            history. Bigfoot nods like he understands. He does not.
            <br><br>
            The spores swirl. The air vibrates. The universe basically says:
            <em>“Choose wisely or get cooked.”</em>

            A rupture in the continuum spits Greg and Bigfoot back into the cabin,
            but nothing matches.
            Their bodies distort, frames skip, colors glitch, and the room breathes
            like it’s buffering a memory of itself.
            <br><br>

            <p>
              Somewhere between dimensions, paranoia, and the munchies, Greg and Bigfoot are stuck
              on what the lab techs call a
              <strong>spatial treadmill for the chronically baked</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The grid keeps generating platforms under their feet — endless, looping, glitching —
              like reality forgot to render the rest of the map.
            </p>
            <p>
              Greg is convinced this is how off-world agencies farm
              <em>human anxiety energy</em>. Bigfoot is convinced he just needs more nachos.
              Neither is technically wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
              This transmission loops forever. Just like their walk. Just like time.
              Just like your last edible.

          <p class="bio-tagline">Paranoid brain. Gold-tier lungs. Accidentally opened a multiverse with snacks.</p>
          <p class="bio-body">
            On paper, Greg is “just some guy in a tinfoil hat.” In practice, he’s a walking red flag
            for every shadowy agency monitoring late-night Wi-Fi traffic.
          </p>
          <p class="bio-body">
            He doomscrolls conspiracy threads for fun, refuses to trust public chargers,
            and still somehow ended up microwaving a piece of classified cheese that ripped
            a hole in reality. He went looking for proof of Bigfoot and instead got
            front-row seats to his own multiversal origin story.
          </p>
          <p class="bio-body">
            Greg is paranoid, sure — but he’s not wrong nearly as often as everyone would like.
            He connects dots no one else even sees… usually while incredibly baked.

          <p class="bio-tagline">Eight feet of vibes. Snack-based belief system. Camera shy, not clout shy.</p>
          <p class="bio-body">
            Bigfoot has been dodging phone cameras and hunters since before the internet.
            Not because he’s scared — he just refuses to get clipped at a bad angle.
          </p>
          <p class="bio-body">
            He runs on a strict diet of smoke, snacks, and not giving a single care about
            what dimension he’s in as long as there’s food. When Greg showed up trying to
            “get evidence,” Bigfoot let him stay — mostly because he kept showing up
            with nachos.
          </p>
          <p class="bio-body">
            Now he’s unwilling co–main character in a government-cheese multiverse breach.
            Does he fully understand the stakes? Absolutely not. Is he still down for
            one more hit and one more trip? Always.
